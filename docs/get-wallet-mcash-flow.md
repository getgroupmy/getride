# GET.wallet × MCash — Integration Flow

This document specifies how **GET.wallet** (the master wallet in the Teksi app) is re-based onto
**MCash** so that the wallet is *actually held by MCash* — MCash becomes the custodian and ledger of
record for GET.wallet money, while the app keeps its current UI and the Supabase ledger becomes a
read-side mirror. It follows the three MCash partner-integration diagrams (Onboarding, Wallet
Reload, Wallet Transfer & Payment), with the **Teksi app** taking the "Eastel App" role.

## Scope — which wallet moves to MCash

| Wallet | Today | With MCash |
|---|---|---|
| **GET.wallet** (`get_wallet`) | Supabase ledger (`wallets` / `wallet_transactions`, RPCs from migration `0066`) | **Held by MCash.** Every balance change is an MCash API call; Supabase mirrors the balance + transactions for realtime UI and history. |
| **GET.credit** (`get_credit`) | Supabase ledger | Stays internal. Recharging GET.credit becomes an MCash **Deduct Wallet** (money leaves the customer's MCash wallet to the Teksi merchant account) followed by the internal `wallet_recharge_credit` credit-in. |
| **GET.coin** (`get_coin`) | Supabase ledger | Stays internal (GC is a reward point, not e-money). Buying GC on `wallet-trade` becomes an MCash **Deduct Wallet**; selling GC becomes an MCash **Wallet Reload** (type `incentive`) from the Teksi merchant account. |

Because MCash is a licensed e-money issuer, the split matters: **RM value lives in MCash;
points/credit stay in our ledger.**

## Architecture

All MCash calls go through a new **`mcash-proxy` Supabase edge function** (same pattern as
`ai-route-proxy`): the MCash API credentials/signing keys live server-side and never reach the
client. The proxy verifies the caller's Supabase JWT (`auth.uid()`), resolves the caller's
`mcash_wallet_id` from `profiles`, calls MCash, and writes the mirror rows
(`wallets.balance`, `wallet_transactions`) with the service role.

```mermaid

  DB -->|"realtime (subscribeWalletRealtime)"| APP
  MCASH -.->|"back office: customer, EKYC,\ntransaction & SOF listings"| PORTAL["MCash Portal"]
```

Client touchpoint: `expo/utils/walletStore.ts` gains an MCash branch that is preferred when the
profile has an `mcash_wallet_id`. The existing Supabase RPC path and the AsyncStorage path remain as
fallbacks, per the repo's graceful-degradation convention.

New profile columns (new migration): `mcash_wallet_id`, `mcash_ekyc_status`
(`never_submit | pending_screening | pending_review | approved | rejected | on_hold | next_screening_due`),
`mcash_customer_status` (`active | inactive | partial_blocked | blacklisted | terminated`).
New mirror column: `wallet_transactions.status`
(`success | failed | pending | processing | paused | cancelled`) with `mcash_ref` for reconciliation
— today every ledger row is implicitly final, but FPX reloads are asynchronous.

## Flow 1 — Onboarding (wallet provisioning)

Runs the first time a signed-in Teksi user opens `app/wallet.tsx`. The app's own auth is unchanged
(`phone-auth` → `otp-verify` → PIN); MCash onboarding piggybacks on it — the verified phone number
is the MCash customer identity.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  START(["User opens Wallet"]) --> CHECK{"profiles.mcash_wallet_id?"}

  subgraph REG ["First-time registration"]
    CHECK -->|"none"| REGISTER["mcash-proxy: Register\n(phone + profile name)"]
    REGISTER --> WID["MCash returns wallet ID\n→ save profiles.mcash_wallet_id"]
    WID --> EKYCQ{"EKYC completed?"}
    EKYCQ -->|"no"| FORM["Prompt EKYC form\n(ID, selfie, personal data)"]
    FORM --> SUBMIT["mcash-proxy: Submit EKYC"]
    SUBMIT --> COMPLETE{"EKYC data complete?"}
    COMPLETE -->|"no — MCash returns\nrequested fields"| FORM
    COMPLETE -->|"yes"| LOGIN
    EKYCQ -->|"yes"| SSO
  end

  subgraph LOG ["Login"]
    CHECK -->|"has wallet ID"| SSO["mcash-proxy: SSO Login"]
    SSO --> VALID{"Validate user"}
    VALID -->|"invalid"| ERR["Prompt error\n(re-register / support)"]
    VALID -->|"valid"| SESSION["Refresh MCash session"]
    SESSION --> DETAILS["mcash-proxy: Wallet Details"]
    DETAILS --> SHOW["wallet.tsx shows GET.wallet\nbalance from MCash"]
  end

  LOGIN["SSO Login"] --> SESSION
  SHOW --> ACTIONS{"User action"}
  ACTIONS -->|"transact"| TXN["Flows 2 & 3"]
  ACTIONS -->|"resubmit EKYC"| SUBMIT
  ACTIONS -->|"change phone (otp-verify)"| UPD["mcash-proxy: Update Profile /\nChange Mobile Number"]
  UPD --> END(["End"])
  TXN --> END
```

Code mapping:

- The wallet-ID check + Register happen in a new `ensureMcashWallet(userId)` in `walletStore.ts`,
  called from `wallet.tsx` on focus (where `fetchWalletBalances` runs today).
- EKYC form is a new screen `app/wallet-ekyc.tsx` (flat `Stack.Screen` in `_layout.tsx`, per
  routing convention). Until `mcash_ekyc_status = approved`, the wallet is view/reload-only with
  MCash's unverified limits; the screen surfaces the EKYC status returned by MCash.
- Phone-number changes already re-verify by OTP; after `verifyOtp` succeeds the app calls the
  proxy's **Update Profile/Change Mobile Number** so the MCash identity follows.
- Customer status (`active`/`blacklisted`/…) from **Customer Listing** is checked on SSO Login; a
  blocked status disables wallet actions in the UI with a support prompt.

## Flow 2 — Wallet Reload (GET.wallet top-up)

Replaces the current simulated top-up (`topUpWallet` → `wallet_topup` RPC, which just mints balance).
The Reload popup on `wallet.tsx` (amount + FPX / Cards method cards) stays as-is; the money now
really moves through MCash.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  START(["Reload popup on wallet.tsx"]) --> DETAILS["mcash-proxy: Wallet Reload Details\n(limits, saved cards, bank list)"]
  DETAILS --> ENTER["User enters amount +\npicks method (FPX / Cards)"]
  ENTER --> METHOD{"Reload method?"}

  subgraph TRANSFER ["Reload transferable wallet"]
    METHOD -->|"FPX"| SOF["Bank SOF validation"]
    SOF --> FPXPAY["Redirect to payment provider\n(in-app browser)"]
    FPXPAY --> FPXRES["Display reload result"]
    FPXRES --> ACK["MCash acknowledges reload result\n(async — webhook to mcash-proxy)"]
    ACK --> SOFQ{"FPX SOF enabled?"}
    SOFQ -->|"yes"| VERIFY["SOF verification"]
    SOFQ -->|"no"| BAL
    VERIFY --> BAL["MCash updates wallet balance\n→ proxy mirrors to Supabase\n→ realtime updates wallet.tsx"]

    METHOD -->|"Card"| BIND["Card binding validation"]
    BIND --> CCPAY["Redirect to payment provider"]
    CCPAY --> CCRES["Display reload result"]
    CCRES --> BAL
  end

  subgraph INCENTIVE ["Reload incentive wallet (platform → user)"]
    INC["Driver incentive / GC sell payout"] --> INCCALL["mcash-proxy: Wallet Reload\nsender: Teksi merchant, type: incentive"]
    INCCALL --> INCBAL["MCash updates wallet balance"]
    DEDUCT["GET.credit recharge / GC buy /\nin-app fees"] --> DEDCALL["mcash-proxy: Deduct Wallet\nreceiver: Teksi merchant, type: ecomm_payout"]
    DEDCALL --> INCBAL
  end

  BAL --> END(["End"])
  INCBAL --> END
```

Key changes vs. today:

- `topUpWallet(userId, amount, method)` becomes *initiate reload*: it returns a payment-provider
  URL from the proxy instead of instantly crediting. A mirror `wallet_transactions` row is written
  with `status = pending` and finalized (`success`/`failed`) when MCash's acknowledgment webhook
  hits the proxy — the existing realtime subscription then refreshes the UI, so no polling.
- Transaction statuses (`Success / Failed / Pending / Processing / Paused / Cancelled`) come from
  MCash's **Transaction Listing & Wallet Movement**; `wallet-history.tsx` shows the status chip on
  pending rows.
- `rechargeCredit` (GET.wallet → GET.credit) becomes: proxy **Deduct Wallet**
  (`type: ecomm_payout`, funds land in the Teksi MCash merchant account) → on success, internal
  `wallet_recharge_credit` credit-in only. Same pattern for GC buys on `wallet-trade.tsx`; GC sells
  and driver incentives pay out with **Wallet Reload** (`type: incentive`) from the merchant
  account (matching the note that incentive & ecomm_payout ride on the merchant account).

## Flow 3 — Wallet Transfer & Payment

Covers the four QR/P2P surfaces that today settle inside the Supabase ledger.

```mermaid

  START(["Start"]) --> WHICH{"Entry point"}

  subgraph RECEIVE ["Receive — wallet-show-code / wallet-receive"]
    WHICH -->|"Show QR"| GEN["mcash-proxy: Generate QR\n(replaces static getpay://u/<id>)"]

    POLL --> SCANNED{"Scanned by?"}
    SCANNED -->|"merchant"| ASPAY["MCash records Payment"]
    SCANNED -->|"customer"| ASTRF["MCash records Transfer"]
    ASPAY --> RBAL["MCash updates balance\n→ mirrored → realtime UI"]
    ASTRF --> RBAL
  end

  subgraph SEND ["Send / pay — wallet-scan"]

    SCAN --> WHO["Returns accountholder details\n(MCash merchant or Teksi customer)"]
    WHO --> CONF1["Display details; user approves\n(optionally redeem GET.coin first —\ncoin part stays internal, MCash pays\nonly the remainder)"]
    CONF1 --> SUB1["mcash-proxy: Submit Transaction"]
    SUB1 --> V1{"Validate"}
    V1 -->|"invalid"| E1["Prompt error"]
    V1 -->|"valid"| SBAL["MCash updates balance"]
  end

  subgraph PHONE ["Send via phone number"]
    WHICH -->|"phone transfer"| EXIST["mcash-proxy: Check User Existence"]
    EXIST --> EX{"Exists?"}
    EX -->|"no"| E2["Prompt error"]
    EX -->|"yes"| CONF2["Display recipient; user approves"]
    CONF2 --> SUB2["mcash-proxy: Submit Transaction"]
    SUB2 --> SBAL
  end

  subgraph INAPP ["In-app purchase — fares, fees"]
    WHICH -->|"pay fare with GET.wallet"| DED["mcash-proxy: Deduct Wallet\n(receiver: Teksi merchant)"]
    DED --> V3{"Validate"}
    V3 -->|"invalid"| E3["Prompt error (e.g. insufficient\nbalance → offer Reload)"]
    V3 -->|"valid"| SBAL
  end

  SBAL --> END(["End"])
  RBAL --> END
```

Code mapping:

- `payFromWallet` (`wallet-scan.tsx`): the GET.coin split (`computeCoinSplit` /
  `wallet_pay p_redeem_coins`) is computed first as today; only the **wallet share** goes to MCash
  **Submit Transaction** (customer QR = Transfer, merchant QR = Payment). The coin redemption stays
  an internal ledger row.
- `wallet-show-code.tsx` / `wallet-receive.tsx`: swap the static `getpay://u/<id>` payload for a
  server-issued MCash QR; **Check QR Status** gives the "you've been paid" acknowledgment the
  screens currently get from the realtime ledger subscription.
- Phone transfers reuse the approval UX from `transferRequestsStore` where the amount is RM
  (GET.wallet): **Check User Existence** replaces the server-side phone resolution in
  `wallet_transfer_coins`. Pure GC transfers keep the existing internal request/approve flow —
  nothing touches MCash.
- Ride-fare payment with GET.wallet and any in-app fee use **Deduct Wallet** into the Teksi
  merchant account. Ride commission (`chargeRideCommission`) is unchanged — it charges the internal
  GET.credit wallet.

## API mapping summary

| MCash integration point | Where it's called from |
|---|---|
| Register | `ensureMcashWallet` on first wallet open (no `mcash_wallet_id`) |
| Submit EKYC | new `app/wallet-ekyc.tsx` |
| SSO Login | wallet open with existing `mcash_wallet_id` |
| Wallet Details | `fetchWalletBalances` (MCash branch) |
| Update Profile / Change Mobile Number | after phone-change OTP verify in `AuthContext` |
| Wallet Reload Details | Reload popup open on `wallet.tsx` |
| Wallet Reload (FPX / card) | `topUpWallet` → provider redirect → webhook |
| Wallet Reload (`incentive`) | GC sell payout, driver incentives (merchant → customer) |
| Deduct Wallet (`ecomm_payout`) | `rechargeCredit`, GC buy, ride-fare/in-app payment |
| Generate QR / Check QR Status | `wallet-show-code.tsx`, `wallet-receive.tsx` |
| Scan QR | `wallet-scan.tsx` |
| Submit Transaction | QR pay & phone transfer confirm |
| Check User Existence | phone-number transfer |
| Transaction Listing & Wallet Movement | reconciliation job in `mcash-proxy`; feeds `wallet_transactions.status` |

## Rollout / degradation

Per the repo convention, the MCash branch is additive and feature-flagged:

1. **No `mcash-proxy` deployed / no MCash credentials** → `walletStore.ts` behaves exactly as
   today (Supabase RPCs, then AsyncStorage). The flag is a settings entry
   (Admin → Settings → Payment Gateway) so it can be toggled without a release.
2. **MCash enabled, user not yet registered/EKYC'd** → wallet opens in mirror-read mode; reload and
   pay are gated behind onboarding (Flow 1).
3. **MCash call fails transiently** → surface the MCash error verbatim where useful
   (insufficient balance → offer Reload); never fall back to minting internal balance, since the
   Supabase ledger is no longer authoritative for `get_wallet`.

Migration of existing balances: a one-time back-office job pays out each user's current
`get_wallet` balance via **Wallet Reload** (`type: incentive`) from the Teksi merchant account once
their MCash wallet is provisioned, stamping the mirror row so it can't double-credit (same
idempotency pattern as `commission_charged_at`).
